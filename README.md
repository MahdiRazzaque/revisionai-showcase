## üíé Advanced Feature Highlight: AI Answer Verification

> **Note:** This feature is fully implemented in the codebase but is **disabled on the live website** to manage the operational costs associated with premium AI models.

RevisionAI includes a powerful answer verification system for MCQ quizzes that acts as an expert quality check. This feature utilises a more advanced, reasoning-focused AI model (**Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro**) to validate the correctness of quiz answers.

#### Why a Smarter Model?
Unlike question generation where the AI has the source text for context, answer verification requires the AI to use its own general knowledge to assess if a marked answer is correct. This is a more complex task that necessitates a more powerful model.

#### The Workflow
1.  A user clicks **"Check Answers"** on an MCQ quiz.
2.  The backend sends the questions to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.
3.  The AI analyses each question and returns a structured JSON response containing:
    *   **Proposed Corrections:** For any answers it identifies as incorrect.
    *   **Unsure Flags:** For questions where it lacks the context to make a confident judgment.
    *   **Justifications:** A clear explanation for every proposed change.
4.  The frontend presents these findings in a clear results dialogue, allowing the user to review and apply the suggested corrections.

This feature significantly improves quiz quality and demonstrates a sophisticated, multi-model AI integration strategy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is a full-stack application built with a modern MERN-style stack, designed for scalability and a rich user experience.

*   **Frontend:** React.js, Material-UI, React Router, Axios, React Context
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.0-flash` for generation, `gemini-2.5-pro` for verification)
*   **Authentication:** Google OAuth 2.0 via Passport.js, with session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
*   **File Processing:** Multer, `unzipper`, `pdf-parse`, `mammoth`

---

## üîß Technical Deep Dive

Here are some of the key technical implementations that power RevisionAI:

*   **Authentication Flow:** The system uses a robust authentication flow with Passport.js for Google OAuth 2.0. On successful callback, a secure JWT is generated and sent to the React client. This token is then used for all subsequent authenticated API requests via an Axios interceptor, which also handles automatic redirection on token expiration or server errors.

*   **AI Integration & Prompt Engineering:** Question generation is powered by the Google Gemini API. The backend constructs detailed, multi-part prompts that include a strict JSON schema. This ensures the AI returns structured, validated data for MCQs, Open-Ended questions, and their respective model answers. A separate, more advanced model is leveraged for the answer verification feature, which operates under its own, stricter rate limits.

*   **Open-Ended Question Lifecycle:** This feature represents a complete, complex workflow. It includes:
    1.  AI generation of questions *and* bullet-pointed model answers.
    2.  A quiz-taking interface with debounced auto-saving to prevent data loss.
    3.  A separate post-attempt marking step where users can choose between AI-powered grading or manual self-assessment.
    4.  A detailed results view that presents the score, AI justification, user answer, and model answer side-by-side.

*   **File Processing Pipeline:** User-uploaded files are handled by a multi-step pipeline using Multer. The system supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, and ZIP files. For ZIP archives, the `unzipper` library extracts files on the server, and text is then parsed from all supported formats before being sent to the AI. A dedicated `File` collection in MongoDB tracks every individual document to ensure accurate storage usage calculations.
